## RAY CHENGOLE NAWANJAYA PORTFOLIO
This is a personal website showcasing my skills and projects that I have managed to come up with so far within three 
months of delving into HTML and CSS. It contains also and ABOUT ME section and phone contacts through which one can be able to locate me.
The whole site is one page. My profile photo is also attached for the viewership of the guest who visits my site.

## Description
It is my intention that whoever will visit my site will be inspired to check out the various styles I have implemented in terms of creating beautiful and 
eye atching Graphical User Interface(GUI). By that very means, whoever would like to work with me in the process of creating a website is highly welcome.
All the sites I have done are meant to showcase the power of using HTML and CSS to come up with an eye catching User Interface.


## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Text Editor such as Visual Studio Code or Atom.
* Knowledge of CSS.
* Linux System.
* If one is on windows, one may install Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL).
* A good internet connection may be required since some attached videos are from online resources.
* A good web browser that can clearly display HTML5 features.



## Known Bugs
At times when the internet is slow, it may take time for the videos and photos attached to load. In such instances, you may need to use a WIFI system or if possible use a SIM network that has a high quality band width. Otherwise, you may have to bear with thte slow speeds.


## Technologies Used
HTML5
-This enabled me to create better data validation pointsfor the nput, without necessarily using a scripting language such as Python or Javascript or PHP.
This is in the case when a user is required to enter his name or email address.
CSS3
-This allowed me to have a better command over the styling of the main outlook of the whole HTML page. It greatly enhanced my GUI.
JavaScript
-This came in handy to ensure responsivity of the navigation bar at the top and to better handle smaller screens by not showing the navigation bar, 
but simply an impressivee menu ICON.
